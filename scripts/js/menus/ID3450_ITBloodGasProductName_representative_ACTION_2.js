/*TODO DEV_NOTES: 3350, 3400 and 3450 have the same verbiage, and are only separate modules so that the serial numbers may be separated by family line, so as to improve recognition.
Several confirmation prompts from this module are being used in module 3400.  If confirmation prompts are changed in this module or in that one, both tables need to evaluated to determine if both may safely change, or if each module needs its own prompts instead.*/
