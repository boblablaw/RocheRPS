/*TODO DEV_NOTES: 3350, 3400 and 3450 have the same verbiage, and are only separate modules so that the serial numbers may be separated by family line, so as to improve recognition.
This module is using confirmation prompts from table 3450.  If any changes are made to those confirmation prompts, but these need to remain the same, this table will need its own confirmation prompts.*/
